    "# Multi-turn Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-turn prompting is a technique where the language model engages in a conversation across multiple exchanges, maintaining context and coherence throughout the dialogue. This approach is useful for simulating interactive assistants, chatbots, or any scenario where follow-up questions and answers are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Multi-turn Prompting Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conversational Context:** The model receives a sequence of messages (user and assistant) and generates context-aware responses.\n",
    "- **Stateful Dialogue:** The model can reference previous turns to provide relevant and coherent answers.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Interaction:** Enables back-and-forth exchanges, clarifications, and deeper exploration of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Retention:** Maintains information across multiple turns for more natural conversations.\n",
    "- **Interactive Experience:** Supports complex, multi-step tasks and clarifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Window Limits:** Very long conversations may exceed the model's context window.\n",
    "- **Potential for Drift:** The model may lose track of context if not managed carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical multi-turn prompt might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> User: What is the capital of France?  \n",
    "> Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.  \n",
    "> User: What is the population of that city?  \n",
    "> Assistant:"
