    "# Role-based Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Role-based prompting is a technique where you instruct the language model to assume a specific role or persona (such as a teacher, interviewer, or expert) to guide its responses. This helps tailor the style, tone, and depth of the model's output to better fit the intended use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Role-based Prompting Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explicit Role Assignment:** The prompt or system message specifies the role the model should play.\n",
    "- **Contextual Responses:** The model adapts its answers to match the assigned persona or expertise.\n",
    "- **Improved Relevance:** Helps generate more contextually appropriate and useful responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customizable Output:** Easily adjust the model's tone and style for different audiences.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Engagement:** Makes interactions more natural and relatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role Clarity Needed:** The effectiveness depends on how clearly the role is defined.\n",
    "- **May Not Fully Emulate Complex Roles:** The model's understanding of nuanced roles is limited by its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical role-based prompt might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You are a French language teacher. Explain the difference between \"bonjour\" and \"bonsoir\" to a beginner."
