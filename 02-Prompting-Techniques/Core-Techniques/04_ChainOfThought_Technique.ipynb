    "# Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique where the prompt encourages the model to reason step-by-step, breaking down complex problems into intermediate steps before arriving at a final answer. This approach improves performance on tasks that require logical reasoning, arithmetic, or multi-step thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Chain-of-Thought Prompting Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** The prompt includes examples where the solution is explained in a sequence of logical steps.\n",
    "- **Encourages Intermediate Steps:** The model is guided to show its reasoning process, not just the final answer.\n",
    "- **Generalization:** Helps the model tackle more complex queries by decomposing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Reasoning:** Especially effective for math, logic, and multi-step problems.\n",
    "- **Transparency:** Makes the model's thought process visible and easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Longer Prompts:** The reasoning process increases prompt length.\n",
    "- **Sensitive to Prompt Design:** The quality of reasoning depends on how well the steps are demonstrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical CoT prompt might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: If there are 3 cars and each car has 4 wheels, how many wheels are there in total?  \n",
    "> A: Each car has 4 wheels. There are 3 cars. So, 3 Ã— 4 = 12 wheels in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: If there are 5 boxes and each box has 6 apples, how many apples are there in total?  \n",
    "> A:"
